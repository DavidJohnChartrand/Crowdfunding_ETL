# Crowdfunding_ETL
For the ETL mini project, I built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After I transformed the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
